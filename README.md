# Data Science & ML – Assignment 1
## Objective

To reinforce foundational Python and data science concepts by independently reproducing all labs from Weeks 1 and 2 and documenting the process professionally.

## Tools Used

Python

Google Colab

Git & GitHub

## Steps Taken

Reproduced all class labs in Google Colab.

Practiced variables, data types, algorithms, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Executed and tested commands to verify correct outputs.

Identified and resolved syntax and logical errors.

Organized work into structured weekly folders in GitHub.

## Lessons Learned

Algorithms require clear, step-by-step thinking.

Lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.

Dictionaries enable efficient key-value data retrieval.

Debugging improves attention to detail and problem-solving skills.

Proper documentation strengthens professionalism.
